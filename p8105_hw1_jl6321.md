# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The variables in the penguins dataset include species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
year. There are 8 columns and 344 rows in total. The mean flipper length
is computed to be 200.9152047 millimeters.

Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm vs. bill\_ length_mm:

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

``` r
df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10), 
  vec_logical = c(vec_numeric > 0), 
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "the", "length", "of", "10"), 
  vec_factor = factor(c("1", "1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "2", "3", "3", "3"))
)
```

The mean of each variable in the dataframe is -0.2638769, 0.5, NA, and
NA, respectively. The mean values of numeric and logical variables can
be obtained while that of character and factor variables cannot.

Apply as.numeric function to logical, character, and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(TRUE)
as.numeric("char")
as.numeric(factor("factors", "hi"))
```

The logical variable can be converted to number with as.numeric function
while character and factor variables cannot. This helps to explain what
happens when trying to take the mean. Logical variables include TRUE and
FALSE, which corresponds to 1 and 0 in numbers, but the example
character and factor variables listed in the code chunk above don’t have
numbers they can get converted to. For instance, if the character
variables are (“1”, “2”) or the factor variables are “factor(”1”, “2”),
they can also be converted to numbers using as.numeric and as.character
functions (unless the factor levels need to be returned).

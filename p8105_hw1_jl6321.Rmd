# Problem 1

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
The variables in the penguins dataset include `r names(penguins)`. There are `r ncol(penguins)` columns and `r nrow(penguins)` rows in total. The mean flipper length is computed to be `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` millimeters.
